What is typescript?
superset of javascript. It has additional featues that js doesnot have and supported by browser.
Features:
Strong types
It has oop concepts like classes, interfaces, access modifiers, generics, constructors
Compile time errors
Gives access to great tools out there
Browsers out there dont understand typescript. We need to compile(transpile) the typescript file to javascript. It is a part
of building our application. When we build our application, ts compiler kicks in and transpiles ts code to js code that browser
can understand.

We should install typescript globally on our machine.
command : npm install -g typescript
to check the typescript version:
command : tsc --version

$ tsc --version
Version 3.7.2

example:
create a new file (main.ts)
function log(message){
    console.log("This is a message : "+message);
}

var newMessage = "Hello World";
log(newMessage);

to transpile(compile) it :
command : tsc main.ts

it will then create a new js file of the same name
to run:
command : node main.js

Declaring a variable:
var a = 10;
let b = 5;


JS version :
ES5 EcmaScript 5 supported by all browsers
ES6

function doSomething(){
    for(var i = 0;i < 5; i++){
        console.log(i);
    }
    console.log("Finally i : "+i);
}
doSomething();

will give : 
0
1
2
3
4
Finally i : 5
this is the problem in using var. As i is available outside the for block.

By default, if we dont assign type to a variable, it will be any.

Class:
Class groups variables and methods that are highly related


Main.ts
================
import {Point} from './point';


Point.ts
====================

export class Point{
	
}



class Test{
	testA: number;
	testB: number;

	constructor(testA: number, testB: number){
		this.testA = testA;
		this.testB = testB;
	}
}

the above code is similar to


class Test{
	constructor(public testA: number, public testB: number){
		
	}
}
